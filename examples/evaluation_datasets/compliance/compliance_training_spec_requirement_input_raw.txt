  "requirements": "# Compliance Training Assignment and Tracking System\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of this project is to develop a Compliance Training Tracker for a mid-sized financial services company. The system will enable compliance officers to assign mandatory training courses, monitor employee completion rates, and generate regulator-ready reports. Employees will have access to a user-friendly dashboard displaying outstanding training modules and deadlines. The solution aims to streamline compliance training management, reduce manual effort, and ensure audit readiness.\n\n## Project Type\nThis is an internal project designed for authenticated users within the financial services company, including compliance officers and employees.\n\n## User Personas\n\n### Compliance Officer\n**ID:** 6a3f1d7e-8b2a-4c9a-9f7d-2e1f4b5c7d8e  \n**Description:** Compliance officers are responsible for ensuring that all employees complete mandatory compliance training on time. They manage course assignments, monitor progress, and generate reports for regulatory audits. They require tools that simplify tracking and reporting to meet FINRA and SEC standards.  \n**Goals:**\n- **ID:** 1f9e3a4b-5c2d-4f7a-8d9e-3b7c6a2f1e4d  **Text:** Assign mandatory compliance courses to employees efficiently  \n- **ID:** 2b7d5c9f-4a1e-4d8b-9f3a-7c6e2d1f5b8a  **Text:** Track training completion rates in real-time  \n- **ID:** 3c9f6a2e-7d4b-4e1a-8f5c-9b2d7e3a6c1f  **Text:** Generate regulator-ready reports compliant with FINRA and SEC requirements  \n\n### Employee\n**ID:** 9d2b7e4a-3c1f-4a8d-9b5e-7f6c2d3a1e9b  \n**Description:** Employees are the end users who must complete assigned compliance training modules. They need a simple and accessible dashboard to view outstanding courses and deadlines, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.  \n**Goals:**\n- **ID:** 4e1a7c9f-6d3b-4f2e-8a5c-9b7d1e3f2a6c  **Text:** View outstanding training modules and deadlines easily  \n- **ID:** 5f3c9b2d-7e1a-4d6f-8c5b-9a2e7d3f1c6b  **Text:** Receive timely reminders via email and Slack to complete training  \n- **ID:** 6a2e9b7d-1f3c-4a5e-8d6b-9c7f2e1a3b4d  **Text:** Access SCORM-compliant training content seamlessly on any device  \n\n### System\n**Description:** This represents automated processes that handle background tasks such as syncing data with external systems, sending notifications, and generating reports without direct user intervention.  \n**Goals:**\n- Automate assignment of training based on HRIS personnel data  \n- Send automated email and Slack reminders for upcoming deadlines  \n- Synchronize course completion data with Cornerstone LMS  \n- Generate audit-ready compliance reports automatically  \n\n## Problem Statement\nWhen managing compliance training manually, compliance officers face challenges with record keeping, missed deadlines, and proving compliance to regulators. I want to automate assignment, tracking, and reporting of compliance training so I can ensure 100% completion before audit deadlines and maintain up-to-date evidence for regulators.\n\n## Goals and Success Metrics\n- Achieve 100% compliance training completion before audit deadlines  \n- Reduce manual administrative effort in tracking and reporting  \n- Provide real-time visibility into training status for compliance officers and employees  \n- Generate regulator-ready reports that satisfy FINRA and SEC audit requirements  \n- Measure success through completion rates, audit pass rates, user satisfaction feedback, and reduction in missed deadlines  \n\n## Additional Context\nThe solution is driven by regulatory requirements from FINRA and SEC audits. The company currently struggles with manual processes that are error-prone and inefficient. Integration with existing systems like Cornerstone LMS and HRIS is critical to maintain data accuracy and streamline workflows. The solution must support mobile and desktop access to accommodate diverse employee work environments.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Must-Haves\n- User authentication and role-based access (compliance officers, employees)  \n- Dashboard for employees showing outstanding training modules and deadlines  \n- Course assignment interface for compliance officers  \n- Tracking and real-time monitoring of training completion rates  \n- Automated email and Slack reminders for training deadlines  \n- Integration with Cornerstone LMS for SCORM-compliant course delivery and completion data  \n- Integration with HRIS for personnel data synchronization  \n- Regulator-ready reporting compliant with FINRA and SEC requirements  \n- Mobile and desktop responsive design  \n\n### Nice-to-Haves\n- Customizable reminder schedules and notification templates  \n- Advanced analytics and trend reporting on training compliance  \n- Ability for employees to provide feedback on training modules  \n- Multi-language support for diverse workforce  \n\n## User Stories\n- As a compliance officer, I want to assign mandatory compliance courses to employees so that they know what training they must complete.  \n- As a compliance officer, I want to track training completion rates in real-time so that I can identify employees who are behind schedule.  \n- As a compliance officer, I want to generate audit-ready reports so that I can provide evidence of compliance to regulators.  \n- As an employee, I want to see a dashboard of my outstanding training modules and deadlines so that I can manage my compliance obligations effectively.  \n- As an employee, I want to receive automated reminders via email and Slack so that I do not miss training deadlines.  \n- As a system, I want to synchronize personnel data from the HRIS so that training assignments reflect current employee status.  \n- As a system, I want to synchronize course completion data from Cornerstone LMS so that training records are accurate and up-to-date.  \n- As a system, I want to send automated reminders to employees to ensure timely completion of training modules.  \n\n## External Systems\n\n### Cornerstone LMS\n**ID:** 8f7a6c5d-4b3e-4d2f-9a1c-7e6b5d4f3a2e  \n**Description:** Learning Management System used for delivering SCORM-compliant training content and tracking course completion.  \n**Goals:**\n- **ID:** 9a1c7e6b-5d4f-3a2e-8f7a-6c5d4b3e4d2f  **Text:** Deliver SCORM-compliant training courses to employees  \n- **ID:** 1c7e6b5d-4f3a-2e8f-7a6c-5d4b3e4d2f9a  **Text:** Provide accurate course completion data for compliance tracking  \n\n### HRIS (Human Resources Information System)\n**ID:** 3b2e1f4d-6a7c-9d8e-5f3b-2a1c4e7d9f0b  \n**Description:** System managing employee personnel data, used to synchronize employee status and assignments.  \n**Goals:**\n- **ID:** 5f3b2a1c-4e7d-9f0b-3b2e-1f4d6a7c9d8e  **Text:** Provide up-to-date personnel data to ensure accurate training assignments  \n- **ID:** 2a1c4e7d-9f0b-3b2e-5f3b-6a7c9d8e1f4d  **Text:** Notify system of personnel changes such as new hires, terminations, or role changes  \n\n## Entities\n- **User**: Represents employees and compliance officers with role-based access  \n- **Training Course**: Compliance training modules, SCORM-compliant content delivered via Cornerstone LMS  \n- **Training Assignment**: Links users to assigned training courses with deadlines  \n- **Training Completion Record**: Tracks completion status and dates for assigned courses  \n- **Reminder Notification**: Automated email and Slack reminders sent to users  \n- **Compliance Report**: Regulator-ready reports summarizing training completion and compliance status  \n- **Personnel Record**: Employee data synchronized from HRIS  \n\n---\n\n**Note:** Additional details on specific reporting formats and integration APIs for Cornerstone LMS and HRIS may be required in follow-up sessions.",
