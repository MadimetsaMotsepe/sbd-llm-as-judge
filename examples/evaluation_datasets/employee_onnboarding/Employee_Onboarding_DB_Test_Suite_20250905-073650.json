enhancements based on the expert feedback. Here are the specific changes:\n\n- **Field Descriptions and Types**: Clarified the purpose of various fields to ensure comprehensive understanding during implementation, while aligning with the identified user goals and tasks.\n  \n- **Permissions Model**: Retained detailed specifications about access controls to ensure that security considerations are met, especially considering the internal nature of the project.\n\n- **Additional Entities and Elements**: Explicit references to invite tracking in the onboarding process and status fields in related entities were included, ensuring tracking of the workflow aligns fully with the completion rates and task efficiency metrics defined in the project's goals.\n\n- **Consideration of Nice-to-Haves**: While the definitive design for aspects like notifications isn't fully realized in the documentation, the structured model allows for easy expansion to include those features as necessary.\n\nThese updates are made to ensure that the design not only meets the original requirements but is also robust and adaptable for future enhancements."
