For example:\n  - The `deal` entity allows sales representatives to manage deal progress, aligning with their user story.\n  - The `forecast_report` entity enables sales managers to generate and review forecasts, addressing their needs.\n  - The `notification` entity supports the automated reminders and nudges, as specified.\n\n### 4. **Integration and Automation**\n- **References for Integration**: The `contact` and `calendar_event` entities include references to external systems (Salesforce CRM and Exchange), indicating that the integration aspects have been considered.\n- **Automated Processes**: The `notification` entity is designed to handle automated messages triggered by system events, which is a crucial feature for addressing user needs around prospect engagement.\n\n### 5. **Data Integrity and Security**\n- **Data Structure**: The output emphasizes maintaining data integrity through unique identifiers (UUIDs) and proper references between entities (e.g., `sales_rep_id` in `deal`, `contact_id`, etc.). \n- **SOC 2 Compliance**: While the tables do not explicitly address SOC 2 compliance in terms of security measures, the structured approach to permissions and data management suggests an underlying focus on security.\n\n### 6. **User Experience Considerations**\n- **User-Friendly Design**: The inclusion of fields such as `name`, `email`, and `phone` across user-related entities indicates a focus on user experience for sales representatives and managers.\n- **Display Fields**: The specification of display fields, such as `Deal Name`, `First Name`, and `Last Name`, enhances usability in user interfaces, ensuring that users can easily identify and interact with records.\n\n### 7. **Nice-to-Haves Consideration**\n- While the core features are adequately covered, the output does not explicitly mention \"nice-to-have\" features, such as customizable Kanban views or advanced analytics. However, the foundational entities and structures can be extended to incorporate these features in future iterations.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the generated output aligns well with the input requirements, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the project goals, user needs, and system architecture. The tables are structured to facilitate the necessary functionality while ensuring data security and integrity. Further refinement may be needed to explicitly address the integration of nice-to-have features and the security measures required for SOC 2 compliance, but the foundation laid here is robust."

Specifically:\n- In the ORIGINAL DESIGN, I refined the language to be more precise and actionable, ensuring it clearly communicates the expectations for the design and model. For example, fields like \"name\" in the `deal` table were changed to \"Deal Name\" to describe their intended usage better.\n- In the STRUCTURED MODEL, I ensured that the JSON structure preserved the essential schema while providing detailed field descriptions, coherent data types, and properly structured nested objects, adhering to the specified schema, making it easier to understand and implement. This also addressed the feedback regarding the need for clear definitions and access controls. Additionally, field names were harmonized to be consistent across both sections. \n- The overall improvements help provide clarity for developers and stakeholders by reflecting a well-thought-out system that meets the organization's needs with an eye towards future enhancements."
