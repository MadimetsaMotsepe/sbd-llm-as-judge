Officers configure mandatory courses and deadlines, assignments are synced from the HRIS, employees complete SCORM modules via Cornerstone LMS, reminders are sent via email and Slack, completion statuses are ingested, audit-ready reports are generated for FINRA/SEC compliance, and exceptions are escalated to ensure 100% completion before audits.\n**ID:** compliance-training-tracker-1
