Specifically:\n- In the ORIGINAL SOLUTION, I refined the content to clarify the workflow's automated triggering mechanism, include more explicit email invitation details, emphasize the importance of including all required fields for UKG, expand on error handling and notification mechanisms, and introduce a feedback mechanism post-onboarding.\n- In the STRUCTURED MODEL, I improved the structure to reflect more detailed instructions for each step, included the security considerations, and clarified the expected outputs while ensuring the parameters and workflow steps remained comprehensive and coherent."
